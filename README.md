Algorithmic Music Generator: The algorithmic generator is a Max MSP patch that analyzes music from MIDI files and will formulate some sort of music generation from it inspired by the concept of Markov Chains. The user can input multiple MIDI files, and the program will collectively build the data to formulate a style of music to generate. In this patch, the user can store two generations, and generate two different styles of music - note that the files uploaded for its respective generation should be transposed to the same key.
